## Enlight

Enlight draws regional plots for GWAS results, and overlays epigenetic modification, DNase sensitivity site, transcription factor binding annotation, eQTL information, HiC-seq interaction onto it. The combined plot will help identify causal variants. Users can also upload custom annotation, obtain text annotation for each SNP.
