Query cleaning mechanism
create a script for cleaning finished queries at certain frequency
a script for cleaning log file

##########
zombie cleaning
controlling total number of running processes

#########
running duration stats (for estimating finishing time, kill proc that takes long time)

######
subroutines are written with returns values like those seen in system() (return 0 if failure,1 if success)

######
tables in both hg18 and hg19 database must have same list of names
